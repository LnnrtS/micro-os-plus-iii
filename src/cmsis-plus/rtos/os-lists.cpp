     * There are at least two strategies:
     * - keep the list ordered by priorities and have the top node
     *  easily accessible the head
     * - preserve the insertion order and perform a full list traversal
     *  to determine the top node.
     *
     * The first strategy requires a partial list traverse with each
     * insert, to find the place to insert the node, but makes
     * retrieving the top priority node trivial, by a single access
     * to the list head.
     *
     * The second strategy might minimise the overall processing
     * time, but always requires a full list traversal to determine
     * the top priority node.
     *
     * On the other hand, typical waiting lists contain only one
     * element, and in this case there is no distinction. Mutex
     * objects occasionally might have two entries (and rarely more).
     * Condition variables might also have several waiting threads,
     * the number is usually small. In these cases, the distinction
     * between the two strategies is also minimal.
     *
     * In the rare cases when the waiting list is large, the first
     * strategy favours top node retrieval, possibly
     * improving the response time, and is thus preferred.

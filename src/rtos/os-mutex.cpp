    /**
     * @class mutex
     * @details
     * A synchronisation object used to allow multiple threads to serialise
     * their access to shared data. The name derives from the capability
     * it provides; namely, **mutual-exclusion**. The thread that has locked
     * a mutex becomes its owner and remains the owner until that same
     * thread unlocks the mutex.
     *
     * @par Tradeoff Between Error Checks and Performance Supported
     *
     * Many error conditions that can occur are not required to be
     * detected by the implementation in order to let implementations
     * trade off performance versus degree of error checking according
     * to the needs of their specific applications and execution
     * environment. As a general rule, conditions caused by the
     * system (such as insufficient memory) are required to be
     * detected, but conditions caused by an erroneously coded
     * application (such as failing to provide adequate synchronisation
     * to prevent a mutex from being deleted while in use) are
     * specified to result in undefined behaviour.
     *
     * A wide range of implementations is thus made possible. For
     * example, an implementation intended for application debugging
     * may implement all of the error checks, but an implementation
     * running a single, provably correct application under very tight
     * performance constraints in an embedded computer might implement
     * minimal checks. An implementation might even be provided in two
     * versions, similar to the options that compilers provide: a
     * full-checking, but slower version; and a limited-checking, but
     * faster version. To forbid this optionality would be a disservice
     * to users.
     *
     * By carefully limiting the use of "undefined behaviour" only to
     * things that an erroneous (badly coded) application might do,
     * and by defining that resource-not-available errors are mandatory,
     * POSIX ensures that a fully-conforming application is portable across
     * the full range of implementations, while not forcing all
     * implementations to add overhead to check for numerous things
     * that a correct program never does. When the behaviour is
     * undefined, no error number is specified to be returned on
     * implementations that do detect the condition. This is because
     * undefined behaviour means anything can happen, which includes
     * returning with any value (which might happen to be a valid, but
     * different, error number). However, since the error number might
     * be useful to application developers when diagnosing problems
     * during application development, a recommendation is made in
     * rationale that implementors should return a particular error
     * number if their implementation does detect the condition.
     *
     * @par Static Initialisers
     *
     * Providing for static initialisation of statically allocated
     * synchronisation objects allows modules with private static
     * synchronisation variables to avoid runtime initialisation
     * tests and overhead. Furthermore, it simplifies the coding of
     * self-initialising modules. Such modules are common in C
     * libraries, where for various reasons the design calls for
     * self-initialisation instead of requiring an explicit module
     * initialisation function to be called. An example use of
     * static initialisation:
     *
     * @code{.cpp}
     * // Create a normal mutex. Same as using the default constructor.
     * mutex mx { normal_initializer };
     *
     * // Create a recursive mutex.
     * mutex rmx { recursive_initializer };
     * @endcode
     *
     * @par Example
     *
     * @code{.cpp}
     * // Protected resource.
     * typedef struct {
     *   int count;
     * } res_t;
     *
     * res_t res;
     *
     * // Mutex to protect the resource.
     * mutex mx;
     *
     * void
     * func(void)
     * {
     *   // Do something
     *
     *   mx.lock();
     *   res.count++;
     *   mx.unlock();

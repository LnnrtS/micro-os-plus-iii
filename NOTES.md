## Purpose

The CMSIS++ package is a proposal for a future CMSIS version, intended for C++ embedded applications.

The specifications are currently work in progress, and any contributions are highly appreciated.

CMSIS++ is currently used by ÂµOS++ III, but has no dependencies on it, and can be used in any other C++ embedded project.

## Documentation

TODO: create a CMSIS++ Doxygen site and add link here.

For reference, the original ARM CMSIS documentation is available form 
[keil.com](http://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/General/html/index.html).

## Tests

* tests/gcc - compile test with host GCC compiler
* tests/eabi-gcc - cross compile test with arm-none-eabi-gcc
